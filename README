Problem Statement:
=================

Do all of the problems in Java and push your results into GitHub. Test Drive your solution to the best of your ability and write the most readable code you can.

When you finish the exercises let me know which one you found the most challenging and how you would rate it on a scale from 1(Trivial) to 5 (Super Tough).

If you get stuck, ask for help from someone else who is doing this homework, your teammates, or email me.
